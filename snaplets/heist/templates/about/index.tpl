  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>This site that hosts some data to act as an example of <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scraping</a>.</p>

  <p>The data on this site is already freely available in a format that's easy
  to download from the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank Data</a>
  site. I've also removed the 60's and 70's to reduce the amount of data.</p>

  <p>NB: The data in this is <strong>the number of Internet users per 100
  people</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Links</h2>

  <p>There are also <a
  href="http://www.ericrochester.com/data-serve/">slides</a> for this
  presentation.</p>

  <p>In the slides, I talk about some resources for learning more about web
  scraping, Internet technologies, and using Python for this. These links are
  in the slides, but they're buried at the end. So that they're easier to get
  to, here they are again:</p>
