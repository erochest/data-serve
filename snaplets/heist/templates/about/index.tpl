  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>This site that hosts some data to act as an example of <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scraping</a>.</p>

  <p>The data on this site is already freely available in a format that's easy
  to download from the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank Data</a>
  site. I've also removed the 60's and 70's to reduce the amount of data.</p>

  <p>NB: The data in this is <strong>the number of Internet users per 100
  people</strong>.</p>
